# Private Events

> In this project, I build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like ‚ÄúAndy‚Äôs House‚Äù).

> A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require me to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about my foreign keys and class names.

## Usage 

- Clone the repo: $ git clone
- Run `bundle install`  in your terminal to install the Ruby gems.
